# UTSA VIVA Projects

This repository contains selected projects and coursework developed for the
VIVA UTSA embedded systems board.

## Contents
- **Final Project** – Full system-level embedded project
- **LCD Practicum** – Timed in-class implementation using an LCD
- **Selected Labs** – Later-course labs demonstrating timers, interrupts,
  ADC, and PWM functionality

Early introductory labs have been intentionally omitted to keep the repository
focused on more substantial work.

All code was written and tested on the VIVA UTSA board.
