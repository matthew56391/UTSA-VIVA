# UTSA VIVA Projects

This repository showcases selected coursework and embedded systems projects completed using the VIVA UTSA development board. The focus is on system-level design, peripheral interfacing, and strengthening core embedded fundamentals.

## Contents
- **Final Project** – A complete system-level embedded design integrating multiple peripherals
- **LCD Practicum** – A timed, in-class implementation demonstrating real-time LCD interfacing
- **Selected Labs** – Later-course labs highlighting timers, interrupts, ADC, and PWM functionality

Earlier introductory labs are intentionally excluded to keep this repository centered on more advanced and technically substantial work.

All code was developed and tested on the VIVA UTSA embedded systems board (PIC16F1829).
