# UTSA VIVA Projects

This repository is a curated selection of coursework and projects, highlighting system-level design, peripheral interfacing, and embedded fundamentals.

## Contents
- **Final Project** – Full system-level embedded project
- **LCD Practicum** – Timed in-class implementation using an LCD
- **Selected Labs** – Later-course labs demonstrating timers, interrupts,
  ADC, and PWM functionality

Early introductory labs have been intentionally omitted to keep the repository
focused on more substantial work.

All code was developed and validated on the VIVA UTSA embedded systems board (PIC16F1829).
